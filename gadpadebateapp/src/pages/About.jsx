                        where public discourse and debate play a crucial role in shaping the future. Our platform
                        serves as a digital town hall, enabling citizens to engage in meaningful discussions about

                        policy to social reform, environmental initiatives to technological advancement. Each debate
                        is structured to promote constructive dialogue and help participants better understand
                        different perspectives on complex issues.

                        The "Heat" system is our innovative approach to measuring and visualizing engagement
                        during live debates. Unlike traditional polling or voting mechanisms, Heat represents
                        the real-time emotional intensity and participation level of the debate community.

                                Heat levels rise and fall based on participant activity, creating a dynamic
                                visual representation of how compelling and engaging each topic is to the audience.
